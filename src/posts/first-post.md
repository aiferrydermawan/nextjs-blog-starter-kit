Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building full-stack web applications simple and efficient.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Better SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints as Node.js serverless functions
- **File-based Routing**: Create routes based on your file structure
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Import CSS files, use CSS modules, or styled-jsx

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js app, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project has the following structure:

```
my-app/
├── pages/          # Routes and pages
├── public/         # Static assets
├── styles/         # CSS files
├── components/     # React components
└── package.json
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, you can:
- Explore the documentation
- Build your first component
- Learn about routing
- Understand data fetching

Happy coding!
